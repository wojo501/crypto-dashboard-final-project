 This project was created by:

It was a final project of university corse. <br/><br/>
The main goal of this project was to vizualize data in real time. We connected to the CoinCap API 2.0 and downloaded data with current stock prices of choosen crypto currencies. <br/><br/>
Project was divided into backend and frontend parts.
We wandted this dashboard to be simple and well looking. <br/> <br/>

# About the project
Team decided to pick up 5 most common crypto currencies:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Tether
- Solana
<br/>

We wanted to display current value of each crypto in dollars. 
Our assumptions about the app were:
- clarity
- simplicity
